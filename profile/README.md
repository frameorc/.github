frameorc is not a framework. It is a collection of libraries that help building
web applications.

[dom](https://frameorc.github.io/doc/dom.html): JavaScript library that helps building user interfaces
in browsers by manipulating DOM trees. Brutally simple and efficient,
it was created with the goal of endowing a single programmer and small teams
with formidable power.

[router](https://frameorc.github.io/doc/router.html): flexible function that dynamically loads
modules and updates the page or a component based on the current route.

[flex.css](https://frameorc.github.io/doc/flex.html): a stylesheet for nested flexible blocks. Great for
building forms and programmatic UIs.
