**[frameorc](https://github.com/frameorc/frameorc)** is not a framework. It is a collection of libraries for building
web applications.

Brutally simple and efficient, it was created with the goal of endowing
a single programmer with formidable power that extends well to teams.

[dom](https://frameorc.github.io/doc/dom.html): a better, shorter, more organised way to define DOM trees.
It replaces HTML without inventing a new syntax while adding predictable dynamic
capabilities, so your interface goes live at once.

[router](https://frameorc.github.io/doc/router.html): split your app into parts that load and update
on-the-fly.

[flex.css](https://frameorc.github.io/doc/flex.html): robust layout builder for forms and programmatic UIs,
achieving the goal with just a few keystrokes. The resulting interfaces are
approachable in coding and play well with version control.

[rpc](https://frameorc.github.io/doc/rpc.html): makes you forget you are using RPC. It allows the server and
browser to call each other's functions as if they are local. It just works.

[state](https://frameorc.github.io/doc/state.html): one of the lightest and fastest ways to keep the
persistent state. Useful when heavier databases are an overkill.

[builder](https://frameorc.github.io/doc/builder.html): define your own tiny domain-specific languages with
this foundational implementation of a builder pattern.

[chain](https://frameorc.github.io/doc/chain.html): the simplest and smartest event system that distils the
foundations of a reactive approach.
